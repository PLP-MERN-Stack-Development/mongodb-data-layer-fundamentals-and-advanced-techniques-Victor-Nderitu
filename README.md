## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### üîë Prerequisites
- **MongoDB** installed locally OR a **MongoDB Atlas** account

1. Install MongoDB Community Edition from the [MongoDB Website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2. Start the MongoDB service:
   ```bash
   mongod
   mongod

3. Open the MongoDB shell:

Option 2: MongoDB Atlas Setup

Sign up for MongoDB Atlas
.

Create a cluster and database named plp_bookstore.

Connect to your cluster using MongoDB Compass or mongosh.

Running the Scripts
1. Insert Sample Data

Run the following command to insert initial book records:
bash

node insert_books.js
This will create the books collection inside the plp_bookstore database.

2. Run Queries
Option A: Run all queries at once

From the terminal:

mongosh < queries.js

Option B: Run queries interactively

Open mongosh:

mongosh


Copy-paste individual queries from queries.js.
